## Introduction

In this report we will take a look at a simulation of traffic lights working and will verify it

In order to do so, we will need to prove the following features:

- Safety: lights for conflicting paths must not be green simultaniously
- Liveness: if the light is queued to be green, it will become one eventually
- Fairness: each traffic light will become red eventually
